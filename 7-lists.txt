To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. For example, a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks. Take a look at this recipe:

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl
