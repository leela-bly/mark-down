Headers are frequently used on websites, magazine, articles and notices, to draw attention to a section.
They act like title or subtitles.
To make headers in Markdown, you perface the phrase with a hash mark (#)
There are six types of headers, in decreasing sizes:
For example, for a header one (# Header One)
for header three (### Header Three)
