There are two different link types in Markdown
1.The first link style is called an inline link.
For example,
[Visit Github!](www.github.com)
2. Reference link: the link is actually a reference to another place in the document.
Here's an exampl of what we mean:
     Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com
